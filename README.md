# litmus-python: 

This repo consists of Litmus Chaos Experiments written in Python. The examples in this repo are good indicators 
of how to construct the experiments: complete with steady state checks, chaosresult generation, chaos injectionm, 
post chaos checks, create events and reports for observability and configure sinks for these. 

The chaos injection mechanism employed itself may vary ranging right from non-standard/custom approaches to reuse of
popular tools like chaostoolkit.
